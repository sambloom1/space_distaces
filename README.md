# space_distances


An attempt to build a relative distance tool. \
e.g

\
Inputs: \
Earth diameter= 13,000km \
Milky way diameter = 200,000 lightyears

\
Outputs: \
This is relative to 
Earth =0.0001mm diameter
Milky way = 3000 km

\
Also include distances
e.g \
Milky Way diameter = 200,000 light years \
Andromeda diameter = 300,000 light years \
Distance between them = 2.5 million light years

\
Output: \
Milky way diameter = 10m \
Andromed diameter = 15m \
Distance between them = 110 meters
